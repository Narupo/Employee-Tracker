| `id` | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY |
| `name` | VARCHAR(30) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |

### **2. `role`**
| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY |
| `title` | VARCHAR(30) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |
| `salary` | DECIMAL | NOT NULL |
| `department_id` | INTEGER | REFERENCES `department(id)`, NOT NULL |

### **3. `employee`**
| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY |
| `first_name` | VARCHAR(30) | NOT NULL |
| `last_name` | VARCHAR(30) | NOT NULL |
| `role_id` | INTEGER | REFERENCES `role(id)`, NOT NULL |
| `manager_id` | INTEGER | REFERENCES `employee(id)`, NULL |
